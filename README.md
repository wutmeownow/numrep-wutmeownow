According to Landau, the lower recursion formula is more accurate since it accumulates smaller errors as it iterates down in l. Since larger l values have larger roundoff errors, the result's error will have larger relative contributions versus from iterating down in small l values.

Also, if I were to check the limits on ints in python, there would be no end because they are generically precise and unbound.
